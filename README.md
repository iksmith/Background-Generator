# Background-Generator

Honestly, this is my first JS DOM Manipulation where I truly understood the flow and syntax of what needed to be done. I definitely used a few resources for some of the errors, but they were all quickly resolved.
Essentially, this is just a random background generator that provides the CSS gradient for whatever you generated through the color inputs.
I love working on small projects that will have significance for my future larger projects.
